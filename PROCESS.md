## Comic series Marvel has published over time.

Our largest challenge with this dataset was it's size. Since its first comic in 1939 Marvel has published over 47k+ comics. We felt however that many of these comics didn't tell the story of Marvel over time.

We aggregated the data set first by removing broken data (about 1,000 entries), then we filtered out any comic series that didn't last for at least 5 years. This brought our data down to roughly 12k+ comics. Chris sorted through this manually, and placed each comic series into major groups found in the Marvel Universe, so people could see the progress over time of their favorite superhero teams.
